Running the Download file can't actually be done because a lot of the API calls were made multiple times and are really time consuming. Furthermore, we have taken out the api keys for security reasons.


If running the following cell doesn't work, one has to open the Rmd files in the same order as listed below and trigger them manually.
```{r}
source("1-cleaning.Rmd")
source("2-exploration.Rmd")
source("3-train-test-split.Rmd")
source("4-regression-modeling.Rmd")
source("5-tree-modeling.Rmd")
source("6-model-evaluation.Rmd")
```
